# flow-ai-dashboard

Please implement a dashboard using React Flow with the following:

- A canvas area that fills most of the page 
- 3-4 placeholder nodes on the canvas, with labels like "Node 1", "Node 2" etc
- Arrows connecting the nodes in a simple left-to-right flow
- A sidebar area where we can later add controls
- A header area with a title like "AI Agent Dashboard"

Use Chakra UI components where appropriate to make it look nice. The exact styling can be basic for now, we'll improve it later. The key thing is to get the React Flow canvas working with some initial nodes and arrows.
